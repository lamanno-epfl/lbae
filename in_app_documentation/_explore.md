### Explore the Atlas

This **interactive web explorer** enables you to browse and analyze the mouse brain lipidome in a dynamic, intuitive way:

* Visualize **up to three annotated lipids** simultaneously (mapped to RGB), either one brain section at a time along the **rostrocaudal axis** or all sections at once.
* Switch between brains from different **biological conditions**, including all **11 mice**.
* Overlay anatomical annotations from the **Allen Brain Atlas** for spatial context.
* Inspect the full set of **raw m/z peaks**, across all slices and brains.
* Explore **Lipid Programs**, computed using our deep learning model **LipiMap**, which groups lipids into biologically meaningful modules.
* View **NMF embeddings** used to extract these programs and drive clustering.
* Run **differential analyses** between brain regions—either anatomically defined or manually drawn—and visualize results with **volcano plots** highlighting statistically significant lipid differences.
* Discover and navigate **lipizones** via a hierarchical treemap. View them in single slices or across all sections, in any of the 11 brains. You can also download their **ID Cards**, which summarize key features of each lipizone.
* Compare **lipizones** with **cell types** from **Langlieb et al. (2023)** (currently in development), or compare **lipid distributions with gene expression** from the same study’s imputed transcriptomic data.
* Explore **3D reconstructions** of both lipid expressions and lipizones, rendered across the full brain volume.

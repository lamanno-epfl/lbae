## About the Project

The **Lipid Brain Atlas Explorer** is a **Python Dash** web application developed as part of the **Lipid Brain Atlas project**, led by the [**Lipid Cell Biology Lab (EPFL)**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dangelo-lab/) and the [**Laboratory of Brain Development and Biological Data Science (EPFL)**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/nsbl/).

We hope this tool will help you explore the **Lipid Brain Atlas**, guiding your experiments and hypotheses toward a deeper understanding of the **cellular and metabolic foundations** of nervous system development and function. By supporting your investigation into the **lipid architecture of the healthy mouse brain** and its **variability across physiological conditions**, we aim to contribute to **functional studies of brain lipids**â€”spanning **evolution**, **pathology**, and **therapeutic response**.

The early version of the app (frontend and backend) was developed by Colas Droin under the supervision of Gioele La Manno and Giovanni d'Angelo, as part of the Lipid Brain Atlas project. The final version was updated and further developed by Francesca Venturi and Luca Fusar Bassini.
